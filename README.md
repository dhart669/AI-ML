# Machine Learning Examples

This repository contains various machine learning examples implemented in Python. Each example demonstrates a different machine learning algorithm and its application to real-world problems.

## Examples

1. **Linear Regression with Gradient Descent**
   - **Description:** Fits a linear model to predict housing prices based on the size of the house.
   - **File:** `linear_regression/gradient_descent.py`
   - **Usage:** Run the script to see gradient descent in action.

2. **Logistic Regression for Diabetes Classification**
   - **Description:** Predicts whether a person has diabetes based on health measurements using logistic regression.
   - **File:** `logistic_regression/diabetes_classification.py`
   - **Usage:** Run the script to train and evaluate a logistic regression model on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

3. **K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation**
   - **Description:** Segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering.
   - **File:** `clustering/customer_segmentation.py`
   - **Usage:** Run the script to see customer segmentation based on synthetic data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python packages are listed in each script and can be installed using `pip`.

## Running the Scripts

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine_learning_examples.git
   cd machine_learning_examples
